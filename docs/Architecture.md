##Address Bus Width and Word Length

     In the realm of computer memory, the number of addresses that can be accessed is determined by the width of the address bus. This width represents the maximum number of unique addresses that the CPU can reference, akin to the number of unique boxes in our grid analogy. In our case, with a 16-bit address bus, the CPU can access up to 65,536 distinct memory locations, each identified by a unique address.

     On the other hand, the word length pertains to the size of the data that can be stored at each memory address.  It defines the range of values that can be represented at a specific location in memory. With an 8-bit word length, each memory address can hold a value ranging from 0 to 255, providing a limited but essential range of numerical and character data that can be stored and manipulated by the CPU.

     Together, the address bus width and word length form the foundational framework of computer memory, enabling the CPU to access and interact with a defined set of memory locations, each capable of holding a specific value within the constraints of the word length.
